# FriendFinder
## A Friend MatchMaking app
Users will be able to find their perfect BFF! All they need to do is answer 10 personality questions and the scores will be matched with previous users!
## Motivation
I wanted created an app that will match users with other previous users. After the user answers 10 questions, a window will appear that will show his/her perfect match's name and picture.
